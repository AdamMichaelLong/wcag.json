wcag.json
=========

WCAG in JSON format for filtering, parsing and other cool stuff.

Why ?
=====

I believe accessibility matters and that the more people will care about it the better our Internet will be. Unfortunately resources about this topic are rare and the main one (WCAG website) is really difficult and time-consuming to go through.

While I plan, once I get all the content in JSON format, to make a _visually better_ version of it, for now my goal is to enable other developers to play around with the WCAG without having to browse the painful interface that is given to us.

If you do make something with it feel free to send me a link or anything, I'd be interested to see what useful tools and informations can be created out of this.

License

Do what you want with it, I don't care, just make sure you don't do anything evil, give credit or don't, doesn't matter either.

Roadmap
=======

I think I have all the content for now but there are improvements and fixes coming.

* More precise relationships between techniques (sometimes 2 or more must be used in conjunction to pass a criterion, sometimes it's one or another, these relationship aren't taken into account yet)
* Scrap some more to get the definition of the techniques
* Add direct links to the WCAG in the JSON whenever possible for "official source"

When this will be done I'll maybe work on the advisory techniques, notes for the techniques and all that, but this will be later, maybe.
