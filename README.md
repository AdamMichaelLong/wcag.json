WCAG in JSON format for filtering, parsing and other cool stuff.

Lot of changes going on
=======================

After wasting countless hours trying to do this by hand, I figured it'd be much better to scrap the WCAG website... Not really an easy task and I have to face unexpected limitations as I go so expect the format to change as I proceed.

This document is not 100% accurate. Some subtleties are not taken into account, such as techniques that must be used in conjunction. Therefor it's advised to check the WCAG section (direct links will be added in the JSON file soon).
